 History App
I produced an Application that is called History App,This Application refers to the inserted Ages of people matching with what kind of iternal events participated during those years for example when you insert that you are 25 years old it will publish the information like "You are 25 years old when Nelson Mandela studied law at the university of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg". The purpose of the app is to be distributed to learners to explore on which events took place in South Africa during the years between 25 and 95.And also its purpose is to make it fun for students to use it and it is not complicated to student which makes it very easy to understand and all the information can be correct if you inserted the correct years or values.And the app is colourful with it's beautiful represented South African flag which makes it more enjoyable for students who are captivated into the history of South Africa.If the App has complications, you are more freely to use the code on understanding how the Application Works.This Application is the future of History which will make students to understand history even more using the apps related to the History App.The exciting Part is that it makes students to have more fun in learning History of South Africans using this kind of Apps,which will generate the knowledge of those who wanted to know that at their age,what was happening in South Africa and this application can accept the ages that are above 25 up to 95.which start a new learning chapter for students to learn using the history App and im sure it will make students more proud and excited to learn History using the app and this will be start on creating a new and exciting applications for students to use on their studies and gain knowledge about the History of South Africa.I hope the assignment is helpful and useful for students to use.
